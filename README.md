# Arduino and ESP32 Projects Repository

This repository contains various projects implemented using Arduino Uno (ATmega328P) and ESP32 microcontrollers. The projects include applications such as distance sensors, LCD displays, and interfacing with APIs for natural language processing tasks.

Explore each project folder for detailed descriptions and code implementations specific to each project.

## Projects included so far

- **Chat Bot Interface with Hugging Face API**: Implements ESP32 to interface with Hugging Face API for natural language processing tasks, displaying responses on an LCD screen.
- **Distance Sensor with Buzzer and LCD Display**: Utilizes Arduino Uno and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement with auditory feedback and LCD display.
- **Volume Display with Potentiometer and LCD Screen**: Displays a volume bar on a 16x2 LCD screen using Arduino Uno and a potentiometer, visualizing analog input as blocks on the screen.


Each project folder includes circuit diagrams (Fritzing), Arduino sketches (.ino), and desc.md files detailing setup, components used, and operation instructions.

Feel free to explore and use these projects for learning and experimentation with Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers.
